# SafetyNet HER - API & Integration Documentation

## 1. Google Gemini API (GenAI)
The "Brain" of the application. Used for:
- SMS Urgency Analysis: Categorizing user stress and risk levels in real-time.
- Predictive Pattern Detection: Analyzing historical data to forecast high-risk windows in the Beasley neighborhood.

Model used: 'gemini-3-flash-preview' (for speed) and 'gemini-3-pro-preview' (for reasoning).

## 2. ElevenLabs (Concept/Future)
The "Voice" of the application.
Used for the "Fake Out" feature (Scenario: User needs an excuse to leave a creepy situation).
- Script: "Hey! Oh my god, I've been trying to reach you! There's a family emergency..."

## 3. Geolocation API
The app requests 'geolocation' permission in metadata.json.
- Used to track user position during "Followed Mode".
- Used to identify the nearest "Safe Haven" (businesses vetted for women's safety).

## 4. Microphone API
Requested for "Evidence Collection" mode.
- Used to record and stream audio/video directly to the mesh cloud so it cannot be deleted by a perpetrator.
